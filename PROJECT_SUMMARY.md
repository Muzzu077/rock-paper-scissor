# Rock Paper Scissors Game - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a real-time Rock-Paper-Scissors game using computer vision and hand gesture recognition. Players can play against a computer opponent by showing hand gestures to their webcam.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **OpenCV**: Video capture, frame processing, and display
- **MediaPipe**: Hand landmark detection and tracking
- **NumPy**: Mathematical operations and array handling
- **Python**: Main programming language

### Key Components

#### 1. Hand Detection System
- **MediaPipe Hands**: 21-point hand landmark detection
- **Real-time tracking**: Continuous hand position monitoring
- **Landmark analysis**: Finger tip vs. joint position comparison

#### 2. Gesture Recognition Engine
```python
# Gesture classification logic
def get_gesture(hand_landmarks):
    # Rock: All fingers closed (fist)
    # Paper: All fingers extended (open palm)  
    # Scissors: Index + middle extended (peace sign)
```

#### 3. Game Logic Engine
- **State machine**: waiting → playing → result → countdown → waiting
- **Score tracking**: Player vs. computer score management
- **Winner determination**: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock

#### 4. User Interface
- **Real-time display**: Live webcam feed with overlay information
- **Visual feedback**: Hand landmarks, scores, game state, results
- **Interactive elements**: Keyboard controls for game management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Webcam (for full game experience)
- Good lighting conditions

### Installation
1. **Clone/Download** the project files
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the launcher**:
   ```bash
   python launcher.py
   ```

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
python launcher.py
```
Choose from:
- Basic Game
- Enhanced Game  
- Gesture Tester
- Demo Game
- Install Dependencies

#### Option 2: Direct Execution
```bash
# Basic game
python rock_paper_scissors_game.py

# Enhanced game
python enhanced_game.py

# Test gestures
python test_gestures.py

# Demo (no webcam needed)
python demo.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Gesture Guide
1. **Rock** 🪨: Make a fist (all fingers closed)
2. **Paper** 📄: Open palm (all fingers extended)
3. **Scissors** ✂️: Peace sign (index + middle finger only)

### Game Flow
1. **Position** your hand in front of the webcam
2. **Show** one of the three gestures
3. **Wait** for the game to detect and process your move
4. **View** the computer's move and round result
5. **Continue** playing - game automatically resets for next round

### Controls
- **'q'**: Quit the game
- **'r'**: Reset scores
- **'b'**: Toggle best-of-5 mode (enhanced version only)

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Basic Version
- Hand gesture detection
- Real-time gameplay
- Score tracking
- Auto-reset between rounds

### Enhanced Version
- Improved gesture detection with confidence scoring
- Gesture history for better accuracy
- Best-of-5 game mode
- Enhanced visual feedback
- Better error handling

### Testing Tools
- **Gesture Tester**: Real-time gesture detection debugging
- **Demo Game**: Game logic testing without webcam

## 🎯 Gesture Detection Algorithm

### Landmark Analysis
```python
# Key landmarks used
wrist = landmark[0]           # Base reference point
thumb_tip = landmark[4]       # Thumb tip
index_tip = landmark[8]       # Index finger tip
middle_tip = landmark[12]     # Middle finger tip
ring_tip = landmark[16]       # Ring finger tip
pinky_tip = landmark[20]      # Pinky finger tip
```

### Detection Logic
1. **Finger Extension Check**: Compare tip Y-coordinate with pip (middle joint) Y-coordinate
2. **Tolerance Adjustment**: Add small tolerance for better detection accuracy
3. **Gesture Classification**: Pattern matching based on finger states
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Assign confidence levels based on gesture clarity

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Hand Detected
- Ensure good lighting
- Position hand clearly in camera view
- Check webcam permissions
- Verify MediaPipe installation

#### Gesture Not Recognized
- Adjust hand position
- Ensure fingers are clearly extended/closed
- Try different lighting conditions
- Use gesture tester for debugging

#### Performance Issues
- Reduce camera resolution if needed
- Close other applications using webcam
- Check system resources

### Error Messages
- **"Could not open webcam"**: Check webcam connection and permissions
- **"Could not read frame"**: Webcam may be in use by another application
- **Import errors**: Verify all dependencies are installed
